# Product Folder

This folder contains two files:

- **product.js**: Exports the `processData` function, which processes an array of strings according to your logic.
- **test.js**: Imports the `processData` function from `product.js`, provides sample input, and prints the output to the console.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Place both `product.js` and `test.js` in this folder.

## How to Run

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
node test.js
```

This will execute `test.js`, which uses the `processData` function and prints the result.

## File Descriptions

- **product.js**:  
  Contains the main logic for processing input data. The exported `processData` function takes an array of strings and returns the processed result.

- **test.js**:  
  Demonstrates usage of `processData` by passing a sample array and logging the output.
